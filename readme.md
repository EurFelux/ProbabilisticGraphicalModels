# Probabilistic Graphical Models

## Environment

- Visual Studio Code
  - R Extension
- Pandoc (to render r-markdown)
- R v4.4.0

You can also use RStudio, but I do not guarantee the usability of the code. I have not tested it in RStudio.

## Exercises Solution

1. Run `Rscript install_requirements.R`.
2. Place `survey.xlsx` and `global_distribution.txt` into the root folder.
3. See `Project_x.rmd` for the solution.
